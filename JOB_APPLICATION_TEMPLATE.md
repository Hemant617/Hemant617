## 🎤 Interview Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**"Tell me about yourself"**
```
I'm a cybersecurity analyst passionate about threat detection and security automation. 

I recently built two security tools that showcase my skills:

First, an automated VirusTotal scanner that processes over 1000 files daily, reducing manual analysis time by 80%. It integrates with 70+ antivirus engines and generates comprehensive threat reports.

Second, a real-time threat log analyzer that detects 8 different attack types including brute force, SQL injection, and XSS attempts, with automated alerting for SOC teams.

During my Deloitte cybersecurity internship, I investigated security incidents, identified IoCs, and created SOC-style incident reports.

I'm now seeking a role where I can apply these skills in a production SOC environment and continue growing as a security analyst.
```

**"Walk me through a security project"**
```
I'll walk you through my VirusTotal Automated Scanner:

PROBLEM: Manual malware analysis is time-consuming and inconsistent.

SOLUTION: I built a Python tool that automates threat analysis using VirusTotal's API.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Designed CLI interface for scanning files, URLs, domains, and IPs
- Implemented batch processing with rate limiting
- Integrated 70+ antivirus engines for comprehensive detection
- Created HTML report generator with detection statistics
- Dockerized for easy deployment

RESULTS:
- Processes 1000+ files per day
- Reduces analysis time by 80%
- Provides consistent, comprehensive threat reports
- Open-sourced on GitHub with full documentation

CHALLENGES: Rate limiting required implementing intelligent queuing and retry logic.

You can see it in action at: github.com/Hemant617/virustotal-automated-scanner
```

**"What's your experience with incident response?"**
```
During my Deloitte cybersecurity internship, I worked on simulated incident response scenarios:

SCENARIO: Suspected unauthorized access to industrial IoT systems

MY APPROACH:
1. Analyzed telemetry logs and web request data
2. Identified suspicious authentication patterns
3. Traced lateral movement across systems
4. Documented IoCs and attack timeline
5. Created SOC-style incident report with remediation steps

I also built a Threat Log Analyzer that automates detection of:
- Brute force attacks
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attacks
- Malware signatures

This tool provides real-time alerting and severity scoring, which would be valuable in a production SOC environment.
